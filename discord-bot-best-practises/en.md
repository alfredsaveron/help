# Best practices for Discord bots


*NB: These guidelines are intended for bots running on public servers. If your bot is restricted to private ones, this document likely doesn't apply to you. It is a **requirement** to meet these when listing your bot on [Discord Extreme List](https://discordextremelist.xyz/bots/submit).*

## Command Prefixes

1. **Commands should be explicitly invoked**  
Bots should not activate on normal chat. Instead, use a command prefix or only respond when your bot is directly @mentioned.

2. **Use unique prefixes**  
Single-character prefixes such as `!`, `$` and `.` are commonplace for activating commands and lead to overlaps with other bots.
Should you opt to use a prefix for your bot, consider using words (`owl`) or unique Unicode characters (`Â¨`). 
Also, you should avoid using `#` or `@` as prefixes since they can be used to mention a channel or a member.
Ideally, your bot's prefix should be configurable on a server-by-server basis, so that the server owners can ensure every bot has its own unique prefix of their choice.

3. **Don't be greedy**  
Restrict yourself to a small number of prefixes to reduce the risk of collision with others.

4. **Don't overuse mentions**  
If you reply directly to a command, don't use a mention, they can lead to bot reply loops. Mentions are fine if a long-running command is executed, but private messages are a good alternative.

5. **Don't use `/` prefix**  
If your bot has `/` as a default prefix it'll interfere with the updated Discord's slash commands ui, that means if there's a slash command with the same name in the server, for example `/ping`, your bot's ping command will be unusable. You may use `/` as a backup prefix, but that's only allowed if your bot has the slash commands with the same name and functions.

## Commands

1. **Have a `help` command**  
A help command that is easily accessible is an absolute requirement.

2. **Don't reply with "invalid command"**  
If a user uses a command that does not exist, then let it fail silently. 
Do not have it reply with something like "invalid command". 
Though if the command is correct, but arguments are wrong then it's okay to reply with "invalid args". If there is more than one bot in a server that shares a prefix, this can result in very obnoxious usage.

3. **Sanitise mentions**  
Commands should not be able to be abused to ping `@roles`, `@everyone` or `@here`. 
This can be handled using `allowed_mentions`. (`allowed_mentions` object - [see the reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#allowed-mentions-object), [allowed_mentions DEL help](https://github.com/discordextremelist/help/blob/master/allowed_mentions/en.md)).
    
## API and behaviour

1. **Be respectful of Discord's API**  
Bots that abuse and misuse the Discord API ruin things for everyone. 
Make sure to factor in rate-limiting and backoff in your bot code, and be intelligent about using the API. 
Make sure to ask for help if you're unsure about the right way to implement things.

2. **Ignore both your own and other bots' messages**  
This helps prevent infinite self-loops and potential security exploits. Using a zero width space such as `\u200B` and `\u180E` in the beginning of each message also prevents your bot from triggering other bots' commands. 
The Discord API also tells you if a user is a bot (`bot` property on `User` objects - [see the reference](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object)).

3. **Keep NSFW features locked to NSFW channels**  
All NSFW commands/features should only work in (Discord) NSFW-marked channels.

4. **Use mentioning the bot to help users.**  
Allowing a mention as the prefix ("@MyBot help") or adding a way to find the bot's prefix with only a mention ("@MyBot" or "@MyBot, what's your prefix?") will help users who are new to your bot in getting started. (Make sure that whatever the message is, it's easily found. A great way to do this is by including it in your bot's presence.) 
The alternative is brute-forcing punctuation characters to find it, which will be difficult for bots following 2 and 3. Plus, a mention is the most unique prefix of all.
